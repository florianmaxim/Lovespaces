The age of digital love spaces has begun.

Modern technology is about to fundamentally change our understanding and of physical space.

Since love is bound to the presence of our physical body love is bound to our concepts of physical space.
The order of space determines the order of love.

(And this is about to chnage so fundamentally)

Let us recognize the potential of the new technological space order!

Burn down our analoge bodies! Let us release our minds into the freedom of new love and lifeconecepts!

Free ourselfes from the old letters of power! Let us unfold ourselfes into the multidimensionality of the new spaces!

Escape the boundaries of the old dualisms! Let us conquer the new spaces of unlimited love!
