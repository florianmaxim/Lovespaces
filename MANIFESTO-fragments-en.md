# Fragments On Love And Space

These are just loose fragments. They make no claim to completeness.

---

1. Technology is about to change our understanding of physical space fundamentally.

2. Love can require physical presence.

3. The way we love might change due to the influence of technology.

---

1. We create social spaces by the usage of technology. 

2. The technology through which we use those spaces creates and influences them as well.

1. Data is the material of digital spaces.

2. Applications are the form of the material.

3. We can not perceive one without the other.

So the app that presents data is ultimately always part of the data and therefore the information itself.

Let's say tinder sends two recommendations to someone's app. That data includes the information that those two human beings exist at the same time. The app though shows one person at a time only. Hence, the information received as data is modified by the app through which we perceive the information.

The way applications modify information by the way it presents and structures data might include certain ideas.

---

1. Once we perceive that information through an app we can rebuild that data.

2. Once we have the data we can (re-)build an app and change the the way of it's presentation.

3. Using a different presentation we can actually modify or even change the information of the data itself.

Let's say we (re-)build tinder. We build another application that shows all incoming recommendations at a time. We would use the same data creating a different information (We see them all right now so they do all exist right now).
